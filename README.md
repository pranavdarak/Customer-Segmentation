# Customer Segmentation App with K-means Clustering

## Overview

This project offers a customer segmentation solution using the K-means clustering technique. By analyzing a dataset containing information such as customer ID, age, gender, annual income, and spending score, the application groups customers into distinct segments based on their similarities in spending behavior.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is derived from the Mall customers dataset, which includes:

- Customer ID
- Age
- Gender
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1-100)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-segmentation-app.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:


3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
customer_segmentation_using_k_means_clustering.py
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `customer_segmentation_using_k_means_clustering.py`.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to preprocess the data, apply K-means clustering, and visualize the customer segments.
3. Experiment with different numbers of clusters and features to tailor the segmentation to your needs.

## Results

After applying K-means clustering, the customers are segmented into distinct groups based on their spending behavior. This segmentation can provide valuable insights for marketing strategies, customer engagement, and personalized recommendations.
